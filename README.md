# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification  

Multiclass Fish Image Classification – Streamlit App
This project is a multiclass fish image classification web application built using Streamlit and PyTorch. It allows users to upload an image of a fish and uses a custom-trained convolutional neural network to identify the fish species among 11 distinct categories. The app features a modern, stylish interface with a vibrant gradient background and a glassy content layout, providing an engaging user experience while delivering fast and accurate predictions.

Features:
Fish Classification:
	•	Upload fish images in JPEG or PNG format.
	•	Predict fish species from 11 predefined categories including “animal fish,” “fish sea_food red_mullet,” “fish sea_food sea_bass,” and more.
	•	Display prediction confidence scores to indicate model certainty.
	•	Interactive uploader with instant classification results.

User Interface:
	•	Gradient background inspired by abstract art with a frosted glass content card.
	•	Clear, bold titles with modern fonts and relevant emoji stickers.
	•	Responsive layout suitable for various screen sizes.
	•	Privacy-focused: Uploaded images are processed in-memory and not stored.

Tech Stack:
	•	Frontend: Streamlit for interactive web UI.
	•	Backend: PyTorch deep learning model for fish species classification.
	•	Image Processing: torchvision transforms for input preprocessing.
	•	Python environment handling PyTorch model loading and inference.
